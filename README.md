# An-Algebra-for-Conformal-Gravity
You can find the mathematica notebook where we work out some of these calculations explicitly. I will keep updating it as we work with different basis and subalgebras. 

We start with the "twistor inspired" basis of C_A's. In order to preserve the structure of these objects, they appear as lists of the form {{a_1,b_1},{a_2,d_2},...}.

-The a_i entries correspond to anything that is not a differential operator. 

-The b_1 correspond to the differential operator \frac{\partial,partial Z_A}. 

Since that operator labels the C_A's, the b_i's entries have form z[l[A]], which I think as "labeled A". The last element of each sublist tells you which is the C_A we are talking about. 

Another note: when working with the notebook, if you want to define some functions or generators make sure the first letter is lowercase, so Mathematica doesn't confuse it with the standard functions.
